# JS Fun at a Restaurant

#### A test suite to develop JavaScript skills

#### Overview & Project Goals
Develop a basic workflow and become familiar with JavaScript and test-driven development.
##### Why this project?
This project provides experience working with primitive JavaScript data types, creating variables and functions, and an introduction to working with classes. This project focuses on the logic of JavaScript and writing DRY code.
##### Learning Goals
- Understand what JavaScript primitives are, and how/when to use them
- Understand how to declare variables and assign data to them
- Practice using objects and arrays

#### How does this work?
- To run this project, fork the original repository at: [js-fun-at-a-restaurant](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/js-fun-at-a-restaurant)
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- `cd` into the Project
- run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies

#### Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- Atom

#### Project Reflection
##### Wins
I was able to complete the project and extension with relatively little assistance. My goal going into the project was to complete the project and gain a beginning understanding of test-driven development and practice pseudocoding. I feel I have been able to achieve this! I also worked on my git workflow, and was able to get into a good flow with that practice.
##### Challenges
Working with logic in this manner is still challenging. One of my project goals was to focus on pseudocoding, and I found that my pseudocode was often way more complicated than the eventual solution.
##### Overall Impressions
I enjoyed this project overall. It was interesting to work through the tests and discover if my logic was matching what the test actually wanted to achieve. I feel more inspired to dive into JavaScript than I did at the beginning of the week, which feels like a win!
##### Future iterations
- Complete [js-fun-at-the-library](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/js-fun-at-the-library)
