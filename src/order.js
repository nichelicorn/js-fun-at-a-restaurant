// SHOULD REMOVE AN ORDER BY ORDER NUMBER
// : expected 3 to equal 2; this is expecting that once deliveryOrders has 3 orders, the first order should be removed? I think this because when the function is called on line 154 of the test, it includes a number that corresponds to the first order. Next, on line 157, the `assert.deepEqual` statement is returing the array of deliveryOrders, and it is displaying a value of just var order2 && order3
// When the function is invoked, 2 arguments are passed through (will want to set up two parameters)
